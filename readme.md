# Performing PCA in Python
In this exercise, we will use Python to perform PCA on a given data matrix.

## Steps

<ol>
<li>Determine the standardized data matrix Z.</li>
<li>Deduce the correlation matrix RX.</li>
<li>Determine the spectrum of RX.</li>
<li>Deduce the principle components matrix CX.</li>
<li>Decide how many principle components we should retain. Justify your decision.</li>
<li>Say whether we were able to predict the result of PCA earlier.</li>


</ol>

## Implementation
The exercise was implemented using the <strong><i>numpy</i></strong> and <strong><i>scikit-learn</i></strong> libraries in Python.


## Conclusion
In this exercise, we have learned how to perform PCA in Python and how to determine the optimal number of principal components to retain.
